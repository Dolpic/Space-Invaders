# Sysmic Invaders

Sysmic Invaders is a personal project.
It is a web game build using the Phaser 3 (https://phaser.io/) framework, to advertise the Sysmic Festival at EPFL (https://www.sysmic.ch/)
 
 ## How does it work ?
 The game is a standalone page, `index.html` that loads the framework and all the project code.
 The main class is `main.js`.
